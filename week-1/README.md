A **class** is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior that objects of a particular type will have. It can be thought of as an architectural blueprint for a house, it's not the house itself, but a design document that specifies what the house will be like, including its rooms, dimensions, and features.

In programming terms, a class defines:
- Attributes (also called fields or instance variables): The properties or data that objects will contain
- Methods (also called behaviors): The actions or operations that objects can perform
- Constructors: Special methods used to create and initialize new objects


A class is abstract and exists only once in your code. You cannot directly use a class—you must create objects from it first.


An **object** is a concrete instance created from a class. It is a real entity that exists in memory during program execution, with actual data values stored in its attributes. If a class is the blueprint for a house, then an object is an actual house built from those blueprints.


Each object:
- Has its own unique identity in memory
- Stores its own specific data in its attributes
- Can perform actions defined by its class's methods
- Maintains its own independent state separate from other objects


You can create many objects from a single class, and each object operates independently with its own data.
